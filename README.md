## Description

It is a big data project to develop Google Page Rank System using spark with java.

## Spark Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support.
## Page Rank
Page rank is an algorithm which is used by google search engine to rank web pages. 
This also assigns numerical weighting to the each algorithm.
PageRank results from a mathematical algorithm based on the webgraph.
The value of rank gives the importance of particular page.
## Page Rank Algorithm

PageRank is a link analysis algorithm and it assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of "measuring" its relative importance within the set. The algorithm may be applied to any collection of entities with reciprocal quotations and references.
